## Code is all we use, but we need something more {#introduction}
{::comment}In this paragraph, give the user the tl;dr lowdown. {:/} 
Links are fantastic, but they should never be the only piece of information in your answer.  You found and put a link in your answer. That's great, but not enough.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
{::comment}In this section, detail why the post has problems{:/} 
Nothing on the internet lasts forever, over time links goes down.  

An analogy would be if you are standing at 100 Main St. and you ask where 98 Main St. is. A good answer would be

>"It is the next building over". points at building

If you instead include a link, you are saying

>"I'll direct you to a tourism information booth, and they will be able to provide you with your answer and much more!"

Which is great, however, you haven't answered their question at all, you've deferred the answering to somewhere else. And in this (fictitious) case the person has to take quite a detour to get to their destination.

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
{::comment}In this section, you can describe why the problem is worth a downvote within the community in which it was posted{:/}
Its great that you took the time to find a link to anwser the question, however thats really not enough.  The author of the question spent the time in asking their question here then did not point to a link to their question.  They will expect to get an anwser here on stack.  

Nothing on the internet lasts forever, over time links goes down.   This link may solve the problem now but what about the future?

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
{::comment}In this section, cover how the problem can be fixed.{:/}
In order to make your question richer and of more value to future users you need to expand it. You you should copy the essencial parts of the link into the answer.  Your anwser should contain enough code and information to help the author solve the problem. 

You dont need to remove the link, but copy the essencial parts of it into the answer. Explain how to solve the problem. The link can be left for future references.

{::comment}The following paragraphs should be added as is to the bottom of all pages{:/}
## Leave a comment! {#leaveacomment}
Once you have done this, leave a comment to the person who sent you this link. They will be happy to retract their downvote.
